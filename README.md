Introduction

Attendance management is a critical task in educational institutions. Traditional paper-based systems are slow, difficult to manage, and prone to errors or data loss.
This project is an Android-based Attendance Management System designed to help teachers digitally record, store, and view student attendance using Firebase. The system provides secure authentication, real-time data synchronization, and easy access to attendance reports.

❗ Problem Statement

Manual attendance systems face several challenges:

Use of physical registers

Difficulty in tracking old attendance records

Risk of data loss or damage

No instant reports or summaries

A digital attendance system solves these issues by automating the attendance process and storing data securely in the cloud.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To develop an Android attendance application using Firebase.

To allow teachers to add students, mark attendance, and view daily or monthly reports.

To securely store attendance records in the cloud.

To provide a simple, clean, and user-friendly interface.

To reduce manual work, errors, and time spent on attendance management.
